# Fraud Detection Project

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset using machine learning techniques. The data is highly unbalanced, so we handle it by downsampling the non-fraudulent transactions. We use Logistic Regression to classify the transactions and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Fraud.csv`.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and explore its shape and distribution of fraud vs non-fraud transactions.

2. **Handling Unbalanced Data**: Downsample the non-fraudulent transactions to balance the dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Check for missing values and outliers.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert categorical values into numerical values and drop unnecessary columns.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Check for correlations in the downsampled data.

6. **Feature Selection and Split**: Select features and split the data into training and testing sets.

7. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train a Logistic Regression model and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model's accuracy and precision on the test data are as follows:

- **Accuracy**: 97%
- **Precision**: 99%
## Conclusion

The model performs reasonably well in detecting fraudulent transactions after handling the class imbalance and removing outliers.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
